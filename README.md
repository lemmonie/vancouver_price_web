# Vancouver Price Web

---
This is the project making a price flyer webpage about Vancouver. As students such as me are pretty poor QAQ, thus I would like
to have a page that could gather all the flyers nearby me.

## Funcition List
1. Gathering all the informations of flyers this week
2. Through entering the post code it could find the nearest store flyers
3. Gather all the flyers into a list
4. By clicking the list of food you will buy, you can ask our strong bot to tell you what to cook tonight with easy steps
5. We could link to Google Maps that you can know where the store are directly
6. We have multiple languages to choose
7. We (might) analyse and or compare how to price goes on
